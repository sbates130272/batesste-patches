Subject: [PATCH v1 0/1] Add an option to stop blktrace based on events recorded
To: linux-btrace@vger.kernel.org
Cc: axboe@kernel.dk

Hi

I am exploring the idea of tying blktrace to a prometheus exporter to
gather more precise block layer activity across a fleet of servers. As
part of that I thought it might be useful to be able to run blktrace
until a user-specified number of events are recorded.

So the following patch adds a new option to do that. I also updated
the relevant documentation.

I'd appreciate feedback or comments on this!

Cheers

Stephen
